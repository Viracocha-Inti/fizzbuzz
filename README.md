# fizzbuzz

This repository contains a simple program to practice some simple JavaScript.

This program will take user's input and print the numbers from 1 to the number the user entered as long as it is less than 50.

If the number is a multiple of 3 the program will print Fizz instead of the number and for multiples of 5 it will print Buzz. Finally, for numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 it will print FizzBuzz.
