        Fizz buzz is a word game that was made to help teach children about
        division. For this game, the user will write a number less than 50. Then
        the program will print the numbers from one to the number the user
        wrote. Numbers that are multiples of three will return as Fizz instead
        of the number and numbers that are multiples of five will return as
        Buzz. Finally, numbers that are multiples of three and five will return
        as FizzBuzz.
